      {/* Description */}
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Raise Your Tribe</strong> is a massive and ambitious project that I dedicated approximately 3.5 years to developing. 
        Technically, itâ€™s highly challenging due to its multiplayer features and the sheer number of mechanics implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pros:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Large-scale multiplayer game with a vast number of mechanics coded entirely by me.</li>
        <li>The only systems I did not personally code are Ultra Dynamic Sky, Shader Compiler (startup screen), Subsystem, and the Vaulting System.</li>
        <li>Extensive experience gained in C++, Blueprints, multiplayer programming, and project management.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Cons:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Despite multiple public playtests, the game still contains minor bugs.</li>
        <li>The game may feel somewhat generic and is often compared to titles like <em>Sons of the Forest</em>, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>, <em>Rust</em>, and <em>DayZ</em>, but naturally falls short due to being a solo project without budget or funding.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Mechanics:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>Procedural animations and realistic weapon recoil</li>
        <li>Main menu and other UIs with key remapping and full game settings</li>
        <li>Character creator</li>
        <li>Football mini-game</li>
        <li>Slot machine mini-game with realistic odds</li>
        <li>Swimming and diving system</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        The game also includes many additional mechanics and systems such as doors, elevators, and more. All systems are designed to function seamlessly in single-player, multiplayer, and online environments. Development was done entirely in C++ and Blueprints. I continue to develop <strong>Raise Your Tribe</strong> at a relaxed, hobbyist pace.
